Objectives:
Speed Control: Maintain a target speed for the mobile robot, adjusting based on encoder feedback.
Distance Control: Ensure a safe distance (minimum gap) from the robot in front using ultrasonic sensor data.
Obstacle Avoidance: Detect unexpected obstacles and stop or reroute if necessary.
Adaptive Response Based on Load: Adjust speed and stopping distance based on the weight of the car body being transferred.
Direction Control: Implement reverse and turn-around functionality in tight spaces.
Prompt:
In Siemens Copilot, create an SCL program to control the mobile robot using PID controllers, handling encoder feedback and ultrasonic sensor input for adaptive speed and distance control. The program should:

PID Speed Controller:

Create a PID loop for speed control. Use encoder feedback to adjust the motor speed to match a target speed based on the load (car body weight).
Implement adaptive gains in the PID to dynamically adjust the speed control based on the load. If a heavier car body is detected, slow down the response to avoid instability.
PID Distance Controller:

Implement a second PID loop to manage the distance to the mobile robot in front using ultrasonic sensor data.
Use this loop to decelerate the robot when approaching the front robot at a distance less than a set threshold (e.g., 2 meters). If the distance is below 1 meter, reduce the speed gradually and initiate braking.
Conditional Obstacle Avoidance:

Integrate obstacle detection using an additional sensor (e.g., LIDAR or infrared).
Write conditional logic to stop the robot if an obstacle is detected within 1 meter. Send an alert if the obstacle remains in the path for more than 5 seconds, then attempt a rerouting maneuver by gradually adjusting speed and direction.
Load-Based Stopping Distance:

Program logic to assess the weight of the car body (using a predefined variable or a sensor reading).
Modify the stopping distance and deceleration curve based on weight. Heavier loads should increase the stopping distance, while lighter loads should decrease it.
Direction Control with Reverse and Turn:

Implement directional control logic that adjusts the PID controller to handle reverse and tight turns.
If the robot reaches a designated turn point, use conditional statements to reduce speed, pause, and then resume movement in the new direction based on a turning radius. Include logic for safe reverse movements if space is tight.
Error Detection and Alert System:

Integrate error handling to log and report conditions such as sensor malfunctions, load inconsistencies, or PID parameter adjustments exceeding expected ranges.
Set up the program to send alerts via HMI or log warnings when control targets are not maintained, such as failure to maintain speed or distance.
